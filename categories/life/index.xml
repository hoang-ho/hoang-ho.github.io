      <description>After 5 months, I still vividly remember my last day at Amazon. I knew very well from the week before what the outcome was and what would happen on that very last day. But I was just a navie kid (I still am), wishing on a shooting star. I cried as it happened &amp;hellip;
Ending 2019 with all goals accomplished, I started 2020 with a complacent attitude and gradually lost momentum for work.</description>

      <description>:-)
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah&amp;rsquo; they were all Yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
it was called Yellow
So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all Yellow
Your skin
Oh yeah&amp;rsquo; your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know?</description>
