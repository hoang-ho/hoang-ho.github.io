Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah&amp;rsquo; they were all Yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
it was called Yellow
So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all Yellow
Your skin
Oh yeah&amp;rsquo; your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know?</description>
