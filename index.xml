      <description>Random fun facts:
 I changed my major three times in college I have two middle names I spent three summers learning to swim (I swim very well now üòù)  Interest I‚Äôm interested in but realistically not getting back onto the machine learning hype train. I worked on a project about neural network compression techniques at UMass Amherst.
I&amp;rsquo;m now exploring domains in software engineering: distributed system, probabilistic databases.</description>

      <description>:-)
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah&amp;rsquo; they were all Yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
it was called Yellow
So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all Yellow
Your skin
Oh yeah&amp;rsquo; your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know?</description>
